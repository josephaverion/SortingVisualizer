# Visualizing Sorting Algorithms
Java Sorting Visualizer using Swing
# Sorting Algorithms
* Insertion Sort
* Selection Sort
* Bubble Sort
* Heap Sort
* Merge Sort
* Quick Sort
# Implementation
By clicking the start button the user shuffles an array length of a value the user chooses with a slider, and is sorted using an algorithm they choose from a dropdown list.
Also, the user can choose how fast the algorithm runs with a slider. While the algorithm runs, the user can see the array bars being sorted where the height of the bar represents 
a value in an array of numbers, and the speed/size modifiers are disabled. The user can reset the array and stop the algorithm using the stop button.
